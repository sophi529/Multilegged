Seed: 84858687
Average velocity = 0.110313
 maxforce for the leg in swing state 0.1
population size to 150 and max generations to 1500
get rid of if net force is 0 vx is 0 and implement stability check
using joint x - joint y and -atan2 (I wasnt using this before damn i forgot to change it but now im using it)
using foot y = joint y - because that makes more sense
model 2... part of the problem might be because of the connections we're using....
changed the layout of the connections code-- and fixed the connections code--it was wrong
copy neuron state no matter what the model
constraint violation --> netforce = 0
