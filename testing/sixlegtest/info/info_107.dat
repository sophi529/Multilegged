Average velocity = 0.613937
 maxforce for the leg in swing state 0.1
population size to 150 and max generations to 1500
get rid of if net force is 0 vx is 0 and implement stability check
model 2... part of the problem might be because of the connections we're using....
changed the layout of the connections code-- and fixed the connections code--it was wrong
copy neuron state no matter what the model
my trig
this model is hitting the same problem as my perfect stepper. it’s going too fast and then stopping because it violates the constraints
