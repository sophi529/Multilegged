Average velocity = 2.10676
 maxforce for the leg in swing state 0.1
population size to 150 and max generations to 1500

using foot y = joint y - because that makes more sense
model 2... part of the problem might be because of the connections we're using....
changed the layout of the connections code
copy neuron state no matter what the model
